          <description><![CDATA[<p>   Hello and welcome to the very first Cloudtopher.com blog post! I first created this site as a way to    host my resume online. I created it as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge (link here for more info).    The last step of the challenge is to create a blog post documenting what you learned throughout the    process of the challenge, so I decided to add an extra step and build my own blog on this site    instead of hosting it somewhere like Medium or Hashnode. </p> <p>   The following posts will be mainly related to the steps of the Cloud Resume Challenge.    I want to talk a little bit about how I completed them and what I learned through each process.    After that, I will be diving into some other DevOps topics as I continue to build more projects,    along with whatever other things I feel compelled to share here. Several of the blog posts will    also have accompanying videos, which I will link in each post. You can also find a link to my    YouTube channel on the sidebar here or on my home page. </p> <p>   Thanks for being here, and I hope you can find some useful information, or just enjoy reading. </p>]]></description>
