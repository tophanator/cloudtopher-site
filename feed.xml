          <description><![CDATA[<p>   I can't really even believe it myself, but here we are with another riveting blog post.   I'm so excited to share more random thoughts with you all.   The only problem is, I have no interesting thoughts to even share.   My mind is just a vast abyss of nothing really going on a lot of the time.   But hey, what are you gonna do? </p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>   I grew up on Newgrounds, Winamp skins, and Flash games, so when I started   the Cloud Resume Challenge I knew I didn’t want another minimalist template.   Instead, I rebuilt a late-90s portal UI using nothing but HTML and CSS. </p> <p>   The site is a fixed-width, 760px layout with chunky borders, tiny Verdana   text, and high-contrast button panels. Under the hood, though, it’s a static   S3 site fronted by CloudFront with HTTPS, caching, and versioned assets. </p>]]></description>
