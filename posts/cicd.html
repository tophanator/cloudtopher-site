  So here we are, at the point where I have successfully set up my CI/CD pipeline (mostly) for the resume site.
  I don't have much else to say about it at the moment, since it's very late and I think I'm done for the night.
  But this post is to celebrate. And to give me an excuse to have another change to push to the repo. Peace out.
