  I grew up on Newgrounds, Winamp skins, and Flash games, so when I started
  the Cloud Resume Challenge I knew I didn’t want another minimalist template.
  Instead, I rebuilt a late-90s portal UI using nothing but HTML and CSS.

  The site is a fixed-width, 760px layout with chunky borders, tiny Verdana
  text, and high-contrast button panels. Under the hood, though, it’s a static
  S3 site fronted by CloudFront with HTTPS, caching, and versioned assets.
