  Hello and welcome to the very first Cloudtopher.com blog post! I first created this site as a way to 
  host my resume online. I created it as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge (link here for more info). 
  The last step of the challenge is to create a blog post documenting what you learned throughout the 
  process of the challenge, so I decided to add an extra step and build my own blog on this site 
  instead of hosting it somewhere like Medium or Hashnode.
</p>
<p>
  The following posts will be mainly related to the steps of the Cloud Resume Challenge. 
  I want to talk a little bit about how I completed them and what I learned through each process. 
  After that, I will be diving into some other DevOps topics as I continue to build more projects, 
  along with whatever other things I feel compelled to share here. Several of the blog posts will 
  also have accompanying videos, which I will link in each post. You can also find a link to my 
  YouTube channel on the sidebar here or on my home page.

  Thanks for being here, and I hope you can find some useful information, or just enjoy reading.
