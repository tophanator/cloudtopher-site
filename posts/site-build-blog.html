  Mark Twain once wrote, "the secret of getting ahead is getting started." Lao Tzu also wrote, 
  "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." I could go on with other motivational 
  quotes I found from my Google search, but maybe we should take this wisdom to heart and dive right 
  into the first part of completing my Cloud Resume Challenge.
</p>

<p>
  The first task of the challenge is technically to acquire the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, 
  but we're going to brush over that. I doubt anyone would want to read about my riveting exam prep process, 
  so we’ll just be going straight into the actionable steps of the project. Hands-on learning is the idea.
</p>

<p>
  Aside from the certification, the (real) first step of the challenge is to write a resume in HTML 
  and style it with CSS. For a while, I’ve been flirting with the idea of designing my resume site 
  with a retro early 2000s feel, because <br>~ n o s t a l g i a ~.

  I grew up exposed to the internet in the early 2000s, so the aesthetic of site design from that 
  era sure does take me back to the good ol' days. After some time browsing on <a href="https://webdesignmuseum.org">webdesignmuseum.org</a> 
  I found a few screencaps that I felt were suitable to use as models for my own site. 
  They had layouts that seemed suitable for a resume and, more importantly, they hit me in 
  those childhood feels.

  I really liked the look of the old Newgrounds site from around 2000. I thought the game icons 
  on the right could be easily converted into links, and each of the boxes of text below the main 
  hero could contain the different sections of my resume (skills, certifications, past employment, etc.).
</p>

<p>
  Once I was sufficiently inspired, it was time to fire up VSCode and get to building the 
  site with HTML. I used ChatGPT to generate a general template of the home page using a 
  screenshot of the Newgrounds page I found. I popped that over to my VSCode file, opened a 
  preview, and got to work on customizing the site.
</p>

<p>
  After a couple hours, I had the home page of my site complete, full with my resume 
  information and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and YouTube pages. Instead of going into 
  the nitty gritty details of the HTML file here, I have linked a video in which I break 
  down all the different sections and explain why I made certain choices. 
  That video can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tophunator">here</a>. To just view my index.html file, you can
